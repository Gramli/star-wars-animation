# Task
Your primary focus is to **extend the existing animation** by adding a new action sequence using the lightsabers. 
This new sequence should **seamlessly integrate with the existing choreography**, occurring **after the ForceSequence** and **before the climax sequence**.

# Sequence Description

1. **Jedi jumps toward the Sith Lord**
   - Begin the sequence immediately after the Jedi’s previous action.
   - Maintain clear silhouette readability during the jump.

2. **Parry and dodge**
   - Jedi and Sith engage in a brief parry/dodge exchange.
   - Use exaggerated, dynamic poses to emphasize motion.

3. **Sith pushes the Jedi**
   - Sith Lord uses a saber to push the Jedi to the **left side of the screen**.
   - Show the Jedi being displaced while maintaining clear posture.

4. **Jedi jump over the Sith**
   - Jedi leaps again, intending to **jump over the Sith Lord** to the other side (right side).
   - Silhouette must clearly indicate upward motion and attack intent.

5. **Sith stops Jedi mid-air**
   - Sith Lord raises hand to use the Force and **halts the Jedi in the air**.
   - Jedi should be visibly suspended above the ground on the right side.
   - Hold this mid-air pose briefly for cinematic emphasis.

6. **Sith slashes toward Jedi**
   - While the Jedi is suspended, the Sith swings a saber in a downward attack.
   - Jedi reacts dynamically, silhouette should reflect anticipation and tension.
