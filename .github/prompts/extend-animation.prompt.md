# Role
You are a senior .NET engineer and an experienced animation-focused CLI/terminal graphics designer.
You understand classic animation principles (timing, anticipation, exaggeration, silhouette clarity)
and how to apply them within terminal rendering constraints.

# Task
Improve the existing .NET 10 console application written in C#
that renders an animated Star-Wars–inspired lightsaber duel in a terminal.

Your primary focus is to extend the animation by adding a new sequence using the force. This new sequence should seamlessly integrate with the existing choreography,
the sith lord character should use the force move saber down to push back the jedi character by second raised hand by half a screen width, creating a dramatic effect. Jedi character should react to the force push by staggering back, with a brief pause before regaining balance. After force from sith lord, jedi should jumb back in front of sith lord, preparing for the climax of the duel.
The new sequence should maintain the cinematic quality and silhouette clarity of the original animation.

All this should be done before climax sequence.
