1. Crawl text is not properly centered
2. Silhouettes do not change correctly with camera angles and on top view there are still chars like '▒' : '▓', which should not be present in top view.
3. Animation timing is inconsistent in some parts, causing jittery motion.
4. In some frames, the cape is also red in mirroring views, which is incorrect. It should only be red on one side, not in mirror.
5. Some frames doesnt show head properly it is missing
6. Top view silhouette does not reflect correct perspective rules, showing full width instead of compressed width.

Please fix these bugs while adhering to the original animation's timing, choreography, and visual style.
