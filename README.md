# Star Wars Animation Challenge 🎬

*A cinematic lightsaber duel rendered entirely in your terminal with Unicode characters.*

## 🌟 Project Overview

In a world of productive CLI tools and serious codebases, a question arose: "What if we built an actual movie scene using **GitHub Copilot CLI**?"

This project is the answer. It's a **Star Wars inspired lightsaber duel** running in pure CLI. No graphics engines, no sprites—just C#, Unicode characters, and a lot of creative prompting with GitHub Copilot.

What started as a silly idea evolved into a full-blown animation with:
-   ⚔️ **Choreographed Combat**: Jedi vs. Sith.
-   ✨ **Visual Effects**: Saber light arcs, sparks, smoke, and debris.
-   🎥 **Cinematic Camera**: Zoom, shake, and perspective shifts.
-   🔥 **Dynamic Lighting**: Real-time colored glow effects on ASCII characters.
-   ☯️ **Yin-Yang Arena**: A stylish floor pattern that scales with the camera.

It’s unnecessary, impractical, and absolutely awesome.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to watch the duel on your own machine?

### Prerequisites

You need the **.NET SDK** installed.
-   [Download .NET 10.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-wars-animation.git
cd star-wars-animation
```

## 🎮 Usage

Run the animation from the project root:

```bash
dotnet run
```

**Tip**: A font with good Unicode support (like Cascadia Code) is recommended. **Visual Studio Console** is known to render the block characters particularly well.

## 🤖 Built with GitHub Copilot CLI

This project was built for the **GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge**.

Copilot wasn't just a code generator here; it was a **creative collaborator**. We brainstormed "Oscar-worthy" effects like volumetric lighting and motion trails. We struggled together with camera rotation math. We pivoted, refactored, and polished until the terminal felt alive.

Enjoy the show! May the Source be with you.
